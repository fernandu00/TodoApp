# TodoApp

A simple Todo list App made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and MongoDB as database.

Used Mongoose to create the database schema for the task object.

The app has a form input to create a new task that is saved into the database. You can delete the task by clicking on it and the task will be deleted based on its ObjectId from the mongodb.
